My name is Sean Harrington. ... More details to come.

<h2>Electronics</h2>
Designing and building embedded systems and circuits is a large hobby of mine. I've designed many circuits and written firmware for many different applications - automotive, wearables, IoT and much more.

<h2>Security</h2>
I have a large interest in infosec and embedded security. I enjoy participating in Capture the Flag and war games to improve my knowledge and skills as I find time. Check out my blog posts for write-ups on solving challenges and games I've completed!

<h2>Motorcycles</h2>
Current motorcycle: None (temporarily...)

Previous: 2006 Yamaha FZ6
<br>
First: 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250r

I hope to focus more on track based riding in the future but nothing beats motorcycling parking in the city (well most cities). I would also like to particpate in trials as a competitive sport at some point!
