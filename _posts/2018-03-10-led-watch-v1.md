title: "LED Watch v1.0"

This post is the first in a series for a project that I started back in 2015 that was aimed at pushing my abilities in PCB design. I decided I wanted to create my first four-layer board and to add to the challenge, do so with a very limited PCB area. The project I came up with is what I call the LED Watch. This post in the series will focus specifically on the design of the first version of the LED Watch (v1.0).

## Other LED Watch Designs

I'm definitely not the first person to design a watch that tells time with LEDs. Before I started, I did some searching on the web to see the work that others have done. A post back in 2012 on Hackaday showed off a LED Pocket Watch created by frank26080115: <https://hackaday.com/2012/11/30/led-pocket-watch-2/>. I decided however that I wanted to create a wristwatch instead of a pocket watch. This therefore required the PCB to be much smaller than frank's design. The layout of LEDs for frank's board was what I had in mind for my design (separate LEDs for hour, minutes, seconds).

I also saw a new wristwatch design back in 2017 from Kevin Cuzner after I had started LED Watch v1.0 which can be seen here: <http://kevincuzner.com/2017/04/18/the-led-wristwatch-a-more-or-less-completed-project/>. This design uses 60 LEDs to tell both minutes and seconds combined instead of 120 LEDs.

## Design v1.0
I started off with a few requirements for my design:
* PCB must fit on my wrist (< 1.5" in diameter)
* Must use an individual LED for each hour, minute, and second and one additional LED to inform AM vs PM.
* LEDs must be controlled from microcontroller in order to customize different animations and potentially add "alarm" feature.
* Time must be fairly precise (no hard metric. My goal was to have less than 1 second deviation after a few years of continuous run time.
* Powered from coin cell for simplicity in both PCB design and potential packaging design later.
* Must be able to reflash microcontroller using a debug port designed into PCB.
* Two push buttons must be present.
* Power-efficient - should be able to run off a single coin cell battery for at least a year before battery replacement.
* Watch should have a configurable timer that turns off LEDs and causes MCU to sleep until user input is detected.

After building my list of requirements, it was time to start with the circuit design and sourcing parts. Because I'm attempting to use 133 leds (12 for hours, 60 for minutes, 60 for seconds, 1 for AM/PM), I had to find a way to control the LEDs with much less than 133 pins as I knew I wouldn't be finding a MCU with that many GPIOs in a user-friendly package. To do this, a multiplexing circuit can be used as seen below:

![4x4 Multiplexed LEDs](/assets/images/multiplexed-leds.png "4x4 Multiplexed LEDs")

The image above shows a 4x4 multiplexer circuit. To create a state where all LEDs are unlit, you would connect A, B, C, D to ground and connect E, F, G, H to the supply voltage (let's assume the supply voltage is 3v3 from here on out). This would cause all of the LEDs to be in reverse-bias and therefore they will be unlit. In order to light up LED L2, you would connect terminal B to the supply voltage and terminal E to ground. We now have a forward-bias voltage across only LED L2. LED L6, L10, and L14 won't turn on because lines F, G, and H are still connected to the supply voltage and the voltage across those LEDs is therefore zero. To turn off L2, simply flip the states for F and B again.

For 16 LEDs, we therefore only need 8 different signals to connect all the LEDs. I now had to expand the multiplexer to work with 132 LEDs (I decided I would leave 1 dedicated GPIO for AM/PM indicator LED). A 12x11 multiplexer will do the trick and can be seen below. 

![11x12 LED Watch Multiplexer](/assets/images/multiplexed-12-11.png "12x11 Multiplexed LEDs")

So far, in order to control the LEDs, we need 24 GPIOs (12 + 11 + 1 for PM LED). Next it's important to determine the minimum microcontroller frequency that is needed to drive this many LEDs with a refresh rate high enough to not be seen as flickering to the human eye. This is because a LED multiplexer/LED matrix circuit such as this has limitations in how many LEDs can be lit at once.

In a multiplexer configuration with a supply voltage of 3.3v and a LED forward voltage drop of approximately 2v, we can only drive a single LED at a time (2 LEDs in series would require approximately 4V in my example). Therefore, if I want to show both hour, minute, and seconds all at the same time, I need to make it appear as if each LED is actually on at the same time. This can be done by switching LEDs on and off at a frequency higher than what our eyes can perceive (at least 60 Hz). I want to have the option of making it appear that every single LED is on at the same time which will mean I need an update rate of 60 Hz * 132 LEDs = 7,920 Hz. 

Another important note for LED matrices is their affect on duty-cycle. Duty cycle is the percent of time that the LED is actually powered. Let's say we want to have all the LEDs to light up with 1 second. Since we can only light one LED at a time in our LED matrix, each LED has only 7.58 ms to light up before it needs to turn off (1 second / 132 LEDS). Therefore, our duty cycle is 0.75% and this will cause the LED to appear dimmer than if the LED had a duty-cycle of 100%. This is the problem with a very large LED matrices such as mine. This however should be fine for my application as long as I use decent LEDs and maximize the amount of current they can source.

Since 8 kHz to update all the LEDs is fairly slow compared to MCU speeds, I decided to pick an update interval of 120 Hz for each LED to prevent any noticeable flicker. We can also use an MCU with a fairly low clock speed. A 8 MHz MCU should do just fine and give plenty of time for other portions of the software to run.

Since I had used many different Texas Instrument MCUs in the past, I first decided to look into their low-power MSP430 line of processors. Upon some searching, I came upon their FRAM based MCUs. These are very low power MCUs that are cheap and offer some benefits over typical flash based systems. However, memory reads are actually destructive in FRAM based systems which means the MCU would need replaced sooner than other MCUs if it was left to run 24/7. I plan to have the MCU enter a low-power sleep mode often to save on the power consumption which should also increase the life of the memory.

I filtered out TI's family of FRAM based microcontrollers by selecting a clock rate of 8 MHz. I then looked for options that had at least 24 GPIOs. I found the MSP430FR57xx family that seemed about perfect for this application - 8 MHz, just enough IO, inexpensive. The options within the 57xx family differ mostly in avaiable onboard memory and extra peripherals such as ADC, I2C, SPI (none of which I need for this project). I decided to go with the MSP430FR5271 which has 4 KB of non-volatile memory and 1 KB of RAM. With the MCU selected, the LEDs and the rest of the BOM could be determined:

| Part 		| Manufacturer 	| P/N 		| Quantity 	| Notes	|

| Tactile Switch |Panasonic	| P16849TR-ND	| 2		| Push buttons	|
| LED		| _Panasonic_	| _LNJ247W82RACT-ND_ | 1		| PM indictor LED |

Unfortunately, I made a few mistakes with the BOM. The first mistake was waiting to finish certain parts of the BOM until after I had finished the board design and sent it out to be machined. The second was with the selection of the PM indictor LED as it's max voltage is less than the 3v3 output from the MCU. I unfortunately wouldn't catch the LED issue until after version 1.1 of the board. 

## Schematic and Board Design
The schematic and board design were completed using Eagle with a license I had at the time for 4-layer boards. Below is the schematic for version v1.0
![Schematic Page 1](/assets/images/schematic_v1.png "Schematic Page 1")
![Schematic Page 2](/assets/images/schematic_v1_page2.png "Schematic Page 2")

Beginning the layout of the PCB can be a difficult task - especially when you have size constraints, lots of components, and many traces that will be required. I knew I would probably need at least four layers in order to route all the components in the size of a typical wristwatch. I would dedicate 1 layer to be a ground plane and use the other 3 layers for traces for the LED matrix. Getting traces between layers requires vias which can take up a lot of room on a board. Normally, you would create only surface pads for a SMD component to be soldered on but in hopes to save room, I changed 1 pad on the LED footprint to be a through-hole with a square pad surrouding the via. This would give me a via connected directly at the via and also allow me to solder down both sides of the LED still. This proved to be extremly useful in saving space.

![Eagle Initial Placement](/assets/images/eagle_before_placement.jpg "EAGLE PCB layout start")

Most of the physical components were designed to be soldered to the top of the board. I wanted the MSP430FR5721 to sit in the center of the board with the LEDs placed in a circular pattern around the outside of the board. Placing all the LEDs in this kind of configuration would be extremely tedious and time consuming. Therefore to place the LEDs in EAGLE, a script was used to command the position and rotation of each LED by name. Instead of writing this EAGLE script out by hand, I decided to write a Python script that would automatically write the coordinates and rotations depending on the radius from the center each LED row should be and how many LEDs are in that row.

Once the MCU and LEDs were placed the first time using the script, the air wires showing the correct connections was a true ratnest. In order to cut down on the routing, I knew there could be a smarter way to place the LEDs into groups. I modified my first version of the script to the one above which caused LEDs within the same LED matrix column to be placed next to each other. This resulted in a cleaner ratnest shown below:

![Ratnest after script changes](/assets/images/eagle_watch_v1_ripup.png "EAGLE Airwires after script changes")

After placing the LEDs in a more efficient layout, the routing could start. I planned on using OSHPark to manufacturer this first version of boards and therefore used their minimum tolerances for most of the traces and vias. I decided to violate the minimum threshold on distances between traces and vias after a friend noted that he had luck doing so in the past with OSHPark without problem. This would give me some more room to work with but did run the risk of there being connections in the final PCB that I didn't intend. The board ended up being four-layers and is 1.2" in diameter. After receiving the boards, I wish I had increased the diameter a bit as the PCB looked a bit small in my opinion. The final board design in EAGLE and the individual layers are below:

![Board design](/assets/images/board_v1.png "EAGLE Board Design")

![Top layer](/assets/images/LED-watch-top.png "Top Layer")

The top layer provided foot pads for the MSP430, all the LEDs, and a few other passive components.

![2nd layer](/assets/images/LED-watch-second.png "Second Layer")

The second layer was used for internal traces that did not fit on the top and bottom layers. I attempted to run all traces on the 2nd layer in an up-down orientation. If a trace was required to run left-right, it was placed on the bottom layer. To route from a connection from the bottom left to top right of the board starting on layer 2, you would run a trace that went up and then create a via to the bottom layer before finally drawing a trace on the bottom layer that went right towards the destination. This overall helped keep traces organized.

![3rd layer](/assets/images/LED-watch-third.png "Third Layer")

The third layer was the designated ground plane.

![Bottom layer](/assets/images/LED-watch-bottom.png "Bottom Layer")

The bottom layer held the foot pads for the battery holder, the debug/programming pads, LED current-limiting resistors, and the button switches. It also contained traces that ran left and right in direction to connect together the LED matrix.

I sent the board to be printed by OSHPark and was happy with the result overall:

## Version 1.0 Issues
Version 1.0 had a very simple but critical error in the board design. When mapping pins on the MCU package, I used a bottom view of the package when assigning pins on the top side of the IC. What this means is that the connections will be incorrect unless I solder the MCU upside down on the board. After realizing this issue, it became clear I needed to create a new version of the board. Outside of the first issue, I also did not give much clearance between the MCU and the tiny 0201 resistor and capacitor foot prints (not to mention I decided all passives would be the standard 0201 foot print without first checking a resistor or capacitor value actually exists in that size).

Another issue was with the design of my external oscillator. Although the crystal was placed close to the MCU as it should be, I missed the surrounding local ground plane that should have been around the crystal and capacitors. Furthermore, I ran traces below the crystal which could potentially generate noise and cause inaccuracies in the generated oscillation frequency.

I therefore never finished assembly version 1.0 of the board as I knew it was better to save the components for my next revision. I also became increasingly busy with other team projects and decided to return back to this project when I had more time. 

# Summary
Although version 1.0 failed in many aspects, it was a success in many ways as well. I still managed to successfully design a LED matrix with 132 LEDs to fit in a very small PCB area (the largest challenge of this project). In my next post, I'll detail the changes and improvements made in version 1.1 of the LED Watch.

If you are interested in checking out version 1.0 of the hardware design, you can check my v1.0 commit for the project on GitHub here: <https://github.com/seanmharrington/LED_Watch/commit/f288cfaf5c4749288d62794df84d2c9c653f7cd2>
